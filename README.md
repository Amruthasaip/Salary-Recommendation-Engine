# Salary-Recommendation-Engine

In this assignment, we will focus on salary prediction. The data set for this assignment includes information on job descriptions and salaries. Use this data set to see if you can predict the salary of a job posting (i.e., the Salary column in the data set) based on the job description. This is important, because this model can make a salary recommendation as soon as a job description is entered into a system.

## Description of Variables
The description of variables are provided in "Jobs - Data Dictionary.docx"

## Goal
Use the jobs_alldata.csv data set and build models to predict salary.

## Results
Tools: Scikit Learn, NLP, Machine Learning Algorithms, Regularization, Neural Networks.
Built Salary Recommendation Engine on text-based job description by leveraging advanced techniques, including TF-IDF, SVD, 
tokenization, & lemmatization, along with machine learning techniques like Voting Regressor, Boosting Models, Regularization, Neural
Networks, to achieve a remarkable 25% improvement in job salary prediction accuracy compared to the baseline prediction model.
